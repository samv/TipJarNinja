# TipJar Ninja

TipJar Ninja is an application which helps you with splitting the bill
at a restaurant.  Ever been out to eat, and one big bill/check comes,
and you need to split it, while letting some people pay extra for
their extra side(s)/drink(s) (or maybe they had one fewer drink than
most folk), pick up other people's checks, and deal with people who
put down cash?
